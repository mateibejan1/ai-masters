# AI Masters @ FMI, UniBuc
A repository for all the projects I'll be doing during my Artificial Intelligence Masters degree at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest.

For now I refrain from adding my theoretical assignments for courses such as Knowledge Representation and Resoning or Advanced Machine Learning, so that future Artificial Intelligence or Data Science MSc students wouldn't be tempted to plagiarize them.

However, I did put together an Machine Learning Theory Exercise Handbook comprised of all exercises I've managed to get my hands on either from the literature or through online medium. The book can be found here: https://github.com/mateibejan14/stl-exercise-handbook.
