# UniBuc FMI AI Masters
A repository for all the projects I'll be doing during my Artificial Intelligence Masters degree at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest.

For now I refrain from adding my theoretical assignments for courses such as Knowledge Representation and Resoning or Advanced Machine Learning, so that future Artificial Intelligence or Data Science MSc students wouldn't be tempted to plagiarize them.
